First, the beet hummus with fresh made tortilla chips was amazing, and unlike anything I've ever had before.  And for dinner we split a baby kale and radicchio salad,  topped with steak.  We had a late lunch so were looking for something light, and this filled the bill perfectly.

The server we had was truly a gem, I wish I could recall her name.

We arrived quite early for our reservation of 5:30 but decided to take advantage of the happy hour drink special. The hostess was so accommodating and went to check if our table was ready and took us right down. Our server was amazing and so knowledgeable. She explained about the different ranches and the steaks that come from each. She was very attentive and chatted with us throughout the evening. My husband had the ribeye from the ranch in Warner and was blown away by how good it was and, let me tell you, heâs VERY particular! I had the flatiron steak which was also delicious. We ordered the beef tallow potatoes and brussel sprouts as our sides. My only negative comment would be that the brussel sprouts seemed a bit overdone. They were quite dark in colour (almost black) and a little on the dry side. The potatoes however, were very good. We finished off with the Baked Alaska which we thoroughly enjoyed.
